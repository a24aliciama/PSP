DU3 - Exercise 3 - Single threaded client-server app - Polybius cipher

We want to create a client-server application to encrypt messages using the polybius cipher.

The client must send a message to be encrypted to the server.

The server should encrypt the message and return the encrypted message to the client.

To encrypt using the polybius cipher use the following table:

Example:

Message: proba

Encrypted message: 34 36 33 12 11
