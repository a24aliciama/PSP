     * DU1 - Review Exercise 3 - Java - Git repository - Steps
     * Create a Java program for the following scenario by creating a maven project in IntellijIDEA.
     * Add the project to a Git repository. Create a README.md.
     * Suppose a person who is able to climb several steps in one go.
     * This ability has led them to travel the world participating in so-called vertical races,
     * such as the world's oldest and most famous tower race in which participants
     * must climb the 1576 steps of the Empire State Building.
     * A normal person would need 1576 steps to climb all those steps.
     * Climbing them two at a time, 788 would be enough, and three at a time only 526.

     * Input
     * The first number in the input indicates how many test cases are to be processed.
     * It is followed by a line for each test case, with two numbers between 1 and 1,000,000.
     * The first one indicates the number of steps and the second one indicates how many steps can be climbed at a time.

     * Example of input
     * 5
     * 1576 1
     * 1576 2
     * 1576 3
     * 4000 1999
     * 3 4

     * Output
     * For each test case the minimum number of jumps needed to climb all the rungs shall be written.
     * Example of output
     * 1576
     * 788
     * 526
     * 3
     * 1

     * Use Javadoc comments to document the program.
     * The final version of the project must be in the Git repository.
     * Execute the program from the command line.
