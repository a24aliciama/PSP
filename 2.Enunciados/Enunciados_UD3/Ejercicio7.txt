DU3 - Exercise 7 - Multi threaded client-server app UDP - Random word

We want to create a client-server application to obtain random words.

The client must send to the server a command entered by the user. The only correct command is:

WORD <number_letters>

If the user does not specify the number of letters (letter_numbers), the default value must be 5.

The server must query a Random Word API web service to obtain a word with the length specified by the user and must send the word to the client.

If the user enters a command that does not exist, the server sends a greeting to the client.

Create a RandomWordClient class to launch the Client. 

Create a RandomWordServer class to launch the Server.

Create a RandomWordServerWorker class for each thread on the Server.
