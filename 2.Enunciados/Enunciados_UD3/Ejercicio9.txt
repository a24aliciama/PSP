DU3 - Exercise 9 - Multi threaded client-server app - UDP - TCP - Number facts

We want to create a client-server application to obtain facts about numbers.

The client must send to the server a command entered by the user. The only correct command is:

NUMBER <number_letters> <TYPE> <number_type>

If the user does not specify the number, or if the user does not use correctly the command, the server sends an Invalid request message to the client.

The server must query a NUMBERS API web service to obtain a fact about the specified number.

UDP:

Create a NumberClientUDP class to launch the Client.

Create a NumberServerUDP class to launch the Server.

Create a NumberServerUDPWorker class for each thread on the Server.
