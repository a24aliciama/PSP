DU2 - Exercise 7 - Java Threads - Atomic variables - Super even numbers

 
A super even number is a whole number in which every digit is even. This means that each digit in the number must be one of the even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Given a set of numbers, we try to determine whether or not they are super even or not by creating a multithreading application.

The main thread must generate two random numbers (use java.util.Random) between 1 and 10000 to determine the numbers we want to check. That main thread must create a pool of four threads.

The main thread must check the numbers between the smallest and the largest of the randomly generated numbers.

For each number it will display a single line showing whether the number is a super even.

Each of the threads created by the main thread must create a thread pool of two threads to check each of the digits of the number. These threads must share an object named Number where the number is stored and a boolean that informs whether or not the number is super even.

Review the following information if you need to wait for threads to finish:

Follow the given specifications to create the application.
